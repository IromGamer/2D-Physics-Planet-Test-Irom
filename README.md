This is a similar project done.
Similar to 2D Physics Minecraft Test. 

This is a no limit game where you can drop apples from your mouse, feel free to edit or modify. Credit - Irom

Feel free to make any amount of planets as you want. Althought the game crashes at a point
 when you create too much planets that are yet to be eaten by other planets.

This project is inspired by Hole.io mobile game.

Things that can make this better:
- making a start and exit menu.
- making different levels menu.
- making a start and end limit.
- making an interstellar design to make this more like astrophysics.
- making easy, medium, hard, and custom modes to enjoy.
- promoting this game.
